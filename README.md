### Multiple Linear Regression

In this HackerRank challenge (Expert Level), a model is to be built to predict house prices using multiple features.  I illustrated with 3 different implementations in 
* R (using lm() function)
* Python (using numpy and sklearn)_
* Octave/Matlab (using Normal Equation)

### Classification Tree and Random Forest in R

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which people did the exercise.  Two models, Fitting Single Tree and Random Forest, are used and results are cross-validated.

### Kafka Producer and Kafka Consumer in Java  

This program illustrates how a Kafka Producer Group sends messages on my_topic, with key = my_key, to Kafka Consumer Group, which consumes messages sent on my_topic.
