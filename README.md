## Multiple LInear Regression (in R, Python and Matlab/Octave)

In this HackerRank challenge, a model is to be built to predict house prices using multiple features.  I illustrated with 3 different implementations in 
* R (using lm() function)
* Python (using numpy and sklearn)_
* Octave/Matlab (using Normal Equation)
