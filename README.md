### Multiple Linear Regression

In this HackerRank challenge, a model is to be built to predict house prices using multiple features.  Solutions are illustrated with 3 different implementations in 
* R (using lm() function)
* Python (using numpy and sklearn)_
* Octave/Matlab (using Normal Equation)

### Classification Tree and Random Forest in R

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which people did the exercise.  Two models, Fitting Single Tree and Random Forest, are used and results are cross-validated.

### Data Pipeline from Yahoo-Finance to MySQL in Python
This program illustrates how to obtain large volume of historical data from public sources (more than 30 years of financial data) and update a database e.g. MySQL.  Similar technique can be used to update other databases e.g. by using Python Driver for Apache Cassandra.
