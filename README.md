### Multiple Linear Regression  

In this HackerRank challenge (Expert Level), a model is to be built to predict house prices using multiple features.  I illustrated with 3 different implementations in 
* R (using lm() function)
* Python (using numpy and sklearn)_
* Octave/Matlab (using Normal Equation)

### Classification Tree and Random Forest

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which people did the exercise.  Two models, Fitting Single Tree and Random Forest, are used and results are cross-validated.
